Stock procurement is often a challenge for businesses since it requires predicting future consumer demand. Demand patterns that are a result of interplay between a multitude of factors make the business problem more complex. Businesses seek to find patterns in consumption as they serve as useful indicators to solve such business problems.

I use Seoulâ€™s bike sharing demand dataset to understand how weather conditions, and holidays affect bike rental demand.
